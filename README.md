# PasteCat

PasteCat is a handy clipboard management utility for Windows that helps you manage and access your clipboard history easily. It allows users to quickly access, copy, and paste previous clipboard items and delete items that are no longer needed.

## Acknowledgements

This project was initially inspired by a joint idea during a hackathon with my friend. We both shared the importance of managing clipboard content while working on various tasks. Although we had different preferences in the main features, we decided to develop our own versions of the idea. A special thanks to [@rmrz-daniel](https://github.com/rmrz-daniel) for his collaboration and support during the development process.

## Installation

To install PasteCat, download the latest release from the GitHub Releases page and extract the contents to a directory of your choice. Run the `PasteCat.exe` file to start the application.

## Usage

Once PasteCat is running, it will automatically store any text copied to the clipboard. If non-text content is copied, PasteCat will be disabled automatically. To re-enable it, right-click on the taskbar icon and select the "Enable" option.

To access your clipboard history, press the default paste hotkey (`Ctrl` + `V`) to open the context menu near your cursor. Click on an item in the list to copy it to the clipboard, or right-click to delete it from the history.

Right-click on the taskbar icon to access features such as enabling or disabling automatic startup, manually enabling the application, and shutting it down.
